# Student Loan Recommendation System

This project leverages deep learning to develop a recommendation system for student loans. It uses historical financial data, educational details, and credit scoring to predict loan repayment success and recommend the most suitable loan options for students.

## Project Overview

This system aims to assist students in identifying appropriate loan options based on their personal and financial circumstances. The project follows these main steps:
1. Data preparation and preprocessing.
2. Model training using a neural network.
3. Model evaluation based on accuracy and classification metrics.
4. Loan recommendation generation based on predictions.

## Key Features

- **Deep Learning Model**: Built using TensorFlow and Keras to predict loan repayment success.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Includes data normalization, feature selection, and train-test splits.
- **Recommendation System**: Utilizes predictions to recommend loans tailored to students' financial situations.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following key features:
- `payment_history`: Numeric representation of the student's historical financial behavior.
- `location_parameter`: Geographic indicator relevant to loan eligibility.
- `stem_degree_score`: Score representing the likelihood of pursuing a STEM degree.
- `gpa_ranking`: Academic performance ranking.
- `financial_aid_score`: Indicator of financial aid received.
- `credit_ranking`: Target variable representing creditworthiness (binary: 0 or 1).
